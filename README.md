Hello!
This is a Tic Tac Toe game project with added To-do list.

The game implements protection against accidental clicks on already filled cells.
We have a cumulative table of victories which shows the winner.
Or shows a draw if it happened.
We also have a "new game" button that clears the playing field and we can start the game again.

Additionally, we have a field with a to-do list in which we can add notes.
To add a note, just enter the text in the field and click the "add" button.
By clicking on a note, we mark it as completed.
A checkmark will appear at the beginning of the note and the text will be crossed out.
If we no longer need a note, we can delete it by clicking on the cross at the end of the note.
In order not to be mistaken, when we hover the pointer over the cross, the cross field will be painted over in red.
